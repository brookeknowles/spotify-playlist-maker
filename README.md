# spotify-playlist-maker

Use REST web app made with python and flask to create a Spotify playlist of the top 20 trending songs on Last.fm via the Spotify and Last.fm APIs. 

Issues to fix: 
- only first 19 songs actually get added to playlist

Todo: 
- add functionality to also be able to make playlist from top songs on billboard/rolling stone/NZtop40 etc
- allow for login via spotify so dont have to keep regenerating Spotify API token every hour when it expires.
